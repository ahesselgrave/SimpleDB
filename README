Report for Lab 1

My design decisions were pretty straightforward for this lab. For the most part
the code consisted of trivial accessors or accessors through the Database 
singletons. The most notable decision was to use a
ConcurrentHashMap<PageId, Page> for the BufferPool. I started with an array
for the cache but it became cumbersome to try and locate things, and down
the line it would have been synchronization hell. Switching to the hashmap
made my code far more readable and easier to implement.

I did not make any changes to the API, nor is anything incomplete.

I spent more time on this project than I would have liked. The biggest
road block for me was my inability to read properly. I got stuck on 
HeapFile#readPage because I saw that I couldn't use BufferPool methods.
It took me longer than I care to admit to realize that a static int is not
a method. Later in the project I was getting some Exception discrepancies 
for the HeapFileIterator because I was reading the DbIterator, not the
DbFileIterator. Beyond that, the project was pretty straightforward.

I am also submitting this a day late, so I have used one pass day.

Remaining days: 3
