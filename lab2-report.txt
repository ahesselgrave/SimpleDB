My design decisions were pretty straightforward for this lab. For the
Aggregators, I used HashMaps to hold and update aggregation values as I read
through the tuples. HeapPage was easy to implement using the abstraction 
methods for the bitmap header, and as such HeapFile was straightforward to 
finish implementing too. Honestly, a lot of this lab kind of fell into place
once a few base methods were figured out. My page eviction policy was to 
attempt to flush and evict the first possible page, similar to a PABO policy.

I did not make any changes to the API, nor is anything missing or incomplete.
Every test so far passes.

I would say I spent about 20 hours on this lab mostly because of Delete. The
DeleteTest system test revealed a lot of problems with my HeapPage and HeapFile
implementations from lab1 that the unit tests and lab1 system tests didn't 
catch. Namely, my iterators were total crap to say the least. My HeapFile
iterator didn't like working with things that spanned over multiple pages,
and the HeapPage iterator didn't iterate over the tuples properly. I tried 
for a long time to modify what I had until I just ended up scrapping both files
and rewriting them with a clear slate. Since I knew what to look out for this
second time, it was pretty easy to rewrite. I decided to keep the iterators as
nested classes for HeapFile and HeapPage as that made more sense to me from
an OOP perspective. After a bit of tinkering I got my project to pass all the
tests.
